## Spatial Analyses

* Jeff Hollister at EPA has a great demo for recreating GIS workflows in R: http://jwhollister.com/rgis_lightning_demo/
* `ggmap` is a great package that uses lat/long data as the inputs, follows similar syntax to `ggplot2`: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/kahle-wickham.pdf
* You can make interactive maps that are saved as HTML files using `leafletr`: https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/
* Another RStudio intro to leaflet: http://blog.rstudio.org/2015/06/24/leaflet-interactive-web-maps-with-r/

## Date Handling
Dates can be in a few different formats: character, numeric, POSIXlt, and POSIXct 
* Blog post about character and numeric formats: http://www.r-bloggers.com/date-formats-in-r/
* Article about the Date class and POSIX classes (also has lots of useful examples): http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/ColeBeck/datestimes.pdf
* Useful R package: `lubridate`, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/lubridate.pdf
* Article describing date classes, the R packages `chron` and `lubridate`, and small intro to plotting with dates: http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/2/10/using-times-and-dates-in-r---presentation-code.html

## Matrices
* Matrices vs data frames: http://civilstat.com/2012/04/matrix-vs-data-frame-in-r/
* Quick intro to creating matrices: http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/matrix

## Trend Decomposition
* STL:  `?stl` in the `stats` package, which is always loaded with base R, and http://www.wekaleamstudios.co.uk/posts/seasonal-trend-decomposition-in-r/
* openair package (Kendall-Mann, Seil-Then): http://www.openair-project.org/, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openair/index.html

## Handling/Exporting Output
* For tabular data, format it as a data frame. Then use the `write.csv` or `write.table` functions to export it
* For exporting plots, there is a button in the plots tab in RStudio called “Export”. For in-line exporting of plots, you can save it in many formats using these functions: `jpeg()`, `png()`, `pdf()`, `svg()`, `postscript()`

## ggplot2
* Mailing list, documentation, info on books, and installation info: http://ggplot2.org/
* Cheatsheet for `ggplot2`: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf
* Slide show introduction: https://opr.princeton.edu/workshops/Downloads/2015Jan_ggplot2Koffman.pdf

## Rmarkdown 
Creating dynamic PDFs, word documents, or HTMLs. A place to have code and text all in one document. 
* Basic introduction to what R Markdown really is and how to apply it: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
* USGS uses R Markdown (NWIS Reporting Application - release date sometime in 2016)!!
* Cheatsheet for R Markdown: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf

## Other
* Cheatsheet for `dplyr` and `tidyr` (cleaning up data frames): https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf
* Shiny!
